				<h2>Context</h2>
				<p>I moved to New York 6 months ago with my wife. We used to discuss the relation between catcalls and sexual harassment when we lived in Brazil, so we couldn't help thinking about how different things could be in another country.<br>We figured out that cultural factors may vary dramatically from neighbourhood to neighbourhood in NY. It seems complicated to draw any conclusion on the subject, though we could definitely notice differences.</p>
				<p>The topic has been largely discussed in Brazil as well, thanks to a <a href="http://thinkolga.com/chega-de-fiu-fiu" target="_blank">campaign</a> that helped spread out the debate. A <a href="http://thinkolga.com/2013/09/09/chega-de-fiu-fiu-resultado-da-pesquisa" target="_blank">survey</a> conducted with 7762 brazilian women as part of this campaign shows alarming numbers. For instance, 99.6% of the women said that they have been sexually harassed at least once.</p>

				<h2>The Project</h2>
				<p>A simulation with two groups of elements, representing the dynamics of sexual harassment.<br>
	It was originally developed as a project for the <a href="http://codeforart.cc" target="_blank">Code for Art class</a>, in the <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology" target="_blank">Master of Fine Arts - Design and Technology program</a> at Parsons, The New School for Design.<br>The original code and concept was made in collaboration with <a href="http://skleedesign.com" target="_blank">Seungkyun Lee</a>, using <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc" target="_blank">openFrameworks</a>.<br>The version published in this website runs in javaScript.</p>
